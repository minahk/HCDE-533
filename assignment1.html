            I haphazrdly used a pair of scissors to make a quick prototype to gauge the appropriate dimensions for my Rhino profile. I discovered that when the cuts in the shape are the exact same measurement as the depth of the cardboard, the pieces fall apart.

            <p>
            So I decided to make the width of the cuts 1mm, which is 50% of the depth of the cardboard. In Rhino I created a 40mm square.

            <p>
            I used the "FilletCorners" command and gave the square a corner radius of 4.

            <p>
            In order to create the cuts in the shape, I created a 1mm width rectangle, and duplicated it 4 times. Each one was centered 10mm from the edge of each side of the rounded square.

            </p>
            <p>
            I used the "Trim" command to create the cuts in the shape. Afterward, I used the "Connect" command to join all the points into one unified vector.
