                    Before you start, plug in your machine and download all the software.

                    <h2>Step 1: Design</h2>
                    <p>Tools or software required: Rhino</p>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>1. I measured and wrote down the dimension of your material (height, width, and thickness). The dimensions of my material was 101.92mm x 70.95mm x 1.4mm.</p>
                
                <p>
                    <img src="assignment-4/a4-design-01.jpg" width=1000>
                    <p>2. I opened <b>Rhino</b> and created a bounding box that matched the height and depth of my material. I titled that layer “Material” and lock it once you are done.</p>                
                </p>

                <p>
                    <p>3. In a separate layer titled “Cutting,” I used the "Rectangle" command to create the first panel. I created a 20mm square.</p>
                    <p>4. I used the "Rectangle" command again to create the “slots” in your box. I used the thickness of my copper material as the width of these slots so that the sides of my box fit together evenly without anything sticking out.</p>
                </p>
                

                <p>
                    <p><h2>Step 2: Set up</h2></p>
                    <p>The following documentation is a summary of the steps that are captured in much more detail in Junchao and Danli's <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VhQHSFEldy33ZE8axusFD3CcNbtmtntYTNC6amZCCS4/edit#slide=id.g16fb5769d1f_0_56">"Fabrication prep for Bantam tool" guidelines.</a></p>

                    <p>
                    1. I launched <b>Kicad</b> and imported my .dxf file and made sure the design matched the design in Rhino.
                    </p>
                    <p>2. I plotted my design as a gerber file, plotting only "Edge.Cuts" and exported my design as a .gbr file.</p>
                </p>
