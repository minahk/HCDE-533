                    Before you start, plug in your machine and download all the software.

                    <h2>Step 1: Design</h2>
                    <p>Tools or software required: Rhino</p>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>1. Measure and note the dimension of your material (height, width, and thickness). The dimensions of my material was 101.92mm x 70.95mm x 1.4mm.</p>
                
                <p>
                    <img src="assignment-4/a4-design-01.jpg" width=1000>
                    <p>2. Open <b>Rhino</b> and create a bounding box that matches the height and depth of your material. Title that layer “Material” and lock it once you are done.</p>                
                </p>

                <p>
                    <p>3. In a separate layer titled “Cutting,” use the rectangle tool to create the first panel. I created a 20mm square.</p>
                    <p>4. Use the rectangle tool again to create the “slots” in your box. Use the thickness of your material as the width of these slots so that the sides of your box fit together evenly without anything sticking out.</p>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <img src="assignment-4/a4-design-02.jpg" width=1000>
                    <p>5. Add the “dogbones” to clear space for the corners of those slots since the drill won’t be able to chip away at right angles. You don’t want the dogbones to be sized smaller than the head of the end mill.</p>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <img src="assignment-4/a4-design-03.jpg" width=1000>
                    <p>6. To create the panel that will connect to this one, use the “Copy” command to duplicate this shape.</p>
                </p>


                <p>
                    <p>7. Transform the slots of that second object into slats that will fit into the slots of the first object by moving them to the outside of the shape. Make sure the y-axis of those shapes stay the same!</p>
                    <img src="assignment-4/a4-design-04.jpg" width=1000>
                    <p>8. To make sure the final cut parts actually fit together, you’ll need to reduce the height of the slat by 5-10%. I reduced the height of my slab by 7%. You can do this by selecting the two points of the shape, clicking the y-axis arrow (indicating the direction you want to move the selected points), and entering in the desired value. You might need to play with this value a bit to get the perfect fit so that the parts you create aren’t too loose or too tight. The height of my slot was 93% the height of the slot.</p>

                    <p>Once you change the value, make sure you center-align this shape with the slat in the other rectangle. Do this for all the other slats in this object. Duplicate this shape and put it on the side so that you can easily readjust the height of these slats after your first test run.</p>
