                    Before you start, plug in your machine and download all the software.

                    <h2>Step 1: Design</h2>
                    <p>Tools or software required: Rhino</p>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>1. I measured and wrote down the dimension of your material (height, width, and thickness). The dimensions of my material was 101.92mm x 70.95mm x 1.4mm.</p>
                
                <p>
                    <img src="assignment-4/a4-design-01.jpg" width=1000>
                    <p>2. I opened <b>Rhino</b> and created a bounding box that matched the height and depth of my material. I titled that layer ‚ÄúMaterial‚Äù and lock it once you are done.</p>                
                </p>

                <p>
                    <p>3. In a separate layer titled ‚ÄúCutting,‚Äù I used the "Rectangle" command to create the first panel. I created a 20mm square.</p>
                    <p>4. I used the "Rectangle" command again to create the ‚Äúslots‚Äù in your box. I used the thickness of my copper material as the width of these slots so that the sides of my box fit together evenly without anything sticking out.</p>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <img src="assignment-4/a4-design-02.jpg" width=1000>
                    <p>5. I added the ‚Äúdogbones‚Äù to clear space for the corners of those slots since the drill wouldn't be able to chip away at at the right angles.</p>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <img src="assignment-4/a4-design-03.jpg" width=1000>
                    <p>6. To create the panel that will connect to this one, I used the ‚ÄúCopy‚Äù command to duplicate this curve.</p>
                </p>


                <p>
                    <p>7. I transformed the slots of that second curve into slats that will fit into the slots of the first curve by moving them to the outside of the curve¬†‚Äì making sure the y-axis of those curves stayed the same.</p>
                    <img src="assignment-4/a4-design-04.jpg" width=1000>
                    <p>8. To make sure the final cut parts actually fit together, I reduced the height of the slat by 7%. I did this by selecting the two points of the curve, clicking the y-axis arrow (indicating the direction I want to move the selected points), and entering in the desired value. I had to play with this value a bit to get the perfect fit so that the parts I created weren't too loose or too tight.</p>

                    <p>Once the heights of the slats were reduced, I made sure to center-align this shape with the slots in the other rectangle.</p>
                    <p>9. I then moved the dogbones so they cleared the corners in the second curve.</p>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <img src="assignment-4/a4-design-05.jpg" width=1000>
                    <p>10. Checking fit and alignment. For the prints to fit, the slats should be slightly shorter than the height of the slots.</p>
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    <img src="assignment-4/a4-design-07.jpg" width=1000>
                    <p>11. I used the ‚ÄúTrim‚Äù command or ‚ÄúCurveBoolean‚Äù to trim away elements from both curves.</p>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <img src="assignment-4/a4-design-08.jpg" width=1000>
                    <p>12. I used the "Copy" command to duplicate the curves to create the other two pieces that I needed to create a box.</p>
                    <p>13. I exported the file (cut only) as a .dxf. </p>
                </p>

                    1. I launched <b>Kicad</b> and imported my .dxf file and made sure the design matched the design in Rhino.
                    </p>
                    <p>2. I plotted my design as a gerber file, plotting only "Edge.Cuts" and exported my design as a .gbr file.</p>
                </p>

                    <p><h2>Step 3: Mill</h2></p>

                    <img src="assignment-4/a4-bantam-01.jpg" width=1000>
                    <p>1. I plugged in the CNC mill and launched the Bantam tool app</p>
                    <p>2. I double-side taped my material to another FR1 board (sacrificial layer) and taped that the the bed of the mill.</p>
                    <p>3. I added the end mill and started the process by calibrating the z-axis of the milling bed ‚Äì using the spindle control to make the adjustments.</p>
                    <img src="assignment-4/a4-bantam-02.jpg" width=1000>
                    <p>4. I imported my .dxf file and configured my settings, making sure to toggle off "Traces" and "Holes" in the Toolpaths section since my design was cut only. My first run was a <a href="assignment-4/a4-bantam-03failure.jpg"><u>failure</u></a> because I hadn't done this. </p>
                    <p>5. I finalized the rest of my settings. I measured and inputted my material dimensions and z-offset value and pressed print.</p>

                    <p>It took me two tries to nail the optimal measurement of my slats. The slats in the first design wasn't short enough to fit into the slots. I adjusted the percentage of the heights of the slats in Rhino from 95% to 93% of the height of the slots. Went through the workflow again and pressed print in the Bantam tool. And when I did that... </p>
