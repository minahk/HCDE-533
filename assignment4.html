                    <p>This was a nightmarish task that took what felt like an eternity to get right. I conducted the bed leveling protocol from Filament Friday.</p>

                <h3><FONT COLOR=red>*Disclaimer* I made a mistake and set the following prints to 3cm <b>radius</b> instead of 3cm <b>diameter</b>. The tubes and cylinders are about twice as big as they should be.</FONT></h3>

                    <img src="assignment-3/a3-tube-01.jpg" width=1000></a>
                    <p>I used the "Tube" command in Rhino to create two tubes that are 3cm in height and diameter (1.5cm radius). To create the tube with the single extrusion wall thickness, I set the thickness to .4mm (since the thickness of a wall line count of 2 in Cura is .8mm). 0.8mm was the thickness of the wall of the second tube.</p>

                    <p>I opened them in Cura and printed each one at a time since the cylinder with the double wall extrusion had an additional print setting: random z-alignment.</p>

                    <p>The double wall extrusion print unfortunately wasn't very consistent around its perimeter.</p>
                    <p>The prints took about 32 min each.</p>
