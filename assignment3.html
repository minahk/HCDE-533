            I followed the steps in the instruction manual that came inside the box to assemble the printer. For steps where I needed a little more clarification and/or verification, I watched the <a href="https://youtu.be/ibsOYzXduYc">video of the unboxing and set up process</a>.
            </p>

                <p><h2>Assembly steps:</h2></p>
                <p>1. I screwed in the vertical channels to the base.</p>
                <p>2. I screwed in the power supply and set the voltage to 115V. I then screwed in the display control.</p>
                <p>3. Next, I screwed in the z-axis switch. </p>
                <p>4. Lorem ipsum </p>
                <p>5. Lorem ipsum </p>
                <p>It took approximately 2 hours to complete the assembly.</p>
            </p>

                <h1>Test Prints: Cubes</h1>
                <p> Once the bed leveling protocol was complete, I started the process of printing my first set of cubes.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Steps:</h2>
                <img src="assignment-3/a3-cube-04.png" width="1000"></a>
                <p>1. In <b>Rhino</b>, I created a 2cm cube using the "Box" command. Then I exported it as an STL file.</p>
                <img src="assignment-3/a3-cube-01.jpg" width="1000"></a>
                <p>2. I opened the file in <b>Cura</b>, and printed 3 cubes each at 3 different quality settings: Low, Standard, and Super.</p>
                <h3>Print times:</h3>
                <p>Low quality: 20min</p>
                <p>Standard quality: 26min</p>
                <p>Super quality: 50min</p>
                <img src="assignment-3/a3-cube-02.jpg" width="1000"></a>
                <p>3. After each print, I used my calipers to measure the width and height of each cube.</p>
                <img src="assignment-3/a3-cube-03.jpg" width="1000"></a>
                <p>All prints came within a 1mm tolerance!</p>
                <img src="assignment-3/a3-cube-05.jpg" width="1000"></a>
                <p>I printed another cube with a <b>concentric top and bottom layer</b> at low quality setting. The outside to center printing creates a nice-looking pattern. The measurement for this cube is 19.37x20.20mm.</p>
            </p>

                <img src="assignment-2/a2-2.jpg" width=1000></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                I created a polygon in Grasshopper and attached it to the set point. I used the "Number Slider" component to set the values of the polygon. Just to make it a little more interesting, I created a smaller polygon to cut out of the main polygon. 
            </p>

            Big thanks to our TA Junchao for the incredibly thorough and helpful Grasshopper tutorial.
            Huge thanks to Sara Cagle for reminding me about "Rectangular Array" and when to "Bake."
            Shout out to Tomomi Matsuzaki and Ji Su Park for helping me export my file correctly and adjust settings correctly for laser cutting. So glad I ran into both of you at the Mill.
