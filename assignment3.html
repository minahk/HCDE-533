            I used the "Grasshopper" command in Rhino to open Grasshopper. I created a point in Rhino. With the point selected, I then used the "Point" component in Grasshopper to set the point.

            I created a polygon in Grasshopper and attached it to the set point. I used the "Number Slider" component to set the values of the polygon. Just to make it a little more interesting, I created a smaller polygon to cut out of the main polygon.

            Big thanks to our TA Junchao for the incredibly thorough and helpful Grasshopper tutorial.
            Huge thanks to Sara Cagle for reminding me about "Rectangular Array" and when to "Bake."
            Shout out to Tomomi Matsuzaki and Ji Su Park for helping me export my file correctly and adjust settings correctly for laser cutting. So glad I ran into both of you at the Mill.
