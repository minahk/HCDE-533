                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <p>I found a cute <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4759904">ice cream file</a> on Thingiverse that I decided to use as my object to cast for this assignment. I liked the idea of handing out mini ice cream cones to people during winter.</p>

                    <p>The mesh for the cone needed some work, so I repaired it using "ReduceMesh" and "MeshRepair." </p>
                    <p>I combined them together using "MeshBooleanUnion" and then sliced it in half using "MeshBooleanSplit". I turned the object into a polysurface using "MeshtoNub" so it's easier to handle.</p>
            
                    <br>

                    <p>Then I used a bunch of Boolean commands to combine and subtract surfaces to create the mold for molds.</p>
                    <p>To make it easier for me to remove the silicone once it is set in my mold, I decided to separate the box structure of the mold into two parts: 1. The flat surface with the shape I want to cast 2. The container that the flat surface will sit in. It has a hole in the back for me to press into to take out my mold.
                    <p>The ice cream mesh that I had downloaded from Thingiverse had some issues with non-manifold edges. For that reason, when I converted it into a polysurface using the "MeshtoNurb" command, I wasn't able to BooleanUnion one half of the ice cream object to its base container.</p>
                    <p>However, I wondered if Cura wouldn't see that as an error to print since it was still a closed polysurface. I decided to scale down my model by 50% to do a quick test print.</p>

                    <p>It took about an hour to print the model. They both printed well! And luckily they fit nicely into the mold container.<p>
                    <p>I am in the process of printing them at actual size.</p>
