                    <p>For my final project, I created a seasonal recipe box for 4x6" index-card sized recipes to keep on my kitchen counter. will be used in my kitchen for storing and accumulating recipes for favorite dishes. More than the digital equivalent, the recipe card box will enable simple, distraction-free, hands-free, sharing, contribution and reference during cooking. For this assignment, I created a box for winter recipes. After this class, I plan to creating recipe boxes for the rest of the seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall. My hope is that this recipe box becomes a family heirloom that gets passed down to future generations.</p>

                    <br>

                    <h3>Box dimensions:</h3>
                    <p>Width: 7"; Height: 5.6", Depth: 5.5"</p>
                    <p>[3d model of box]</p>

                    <br>

                    <h3>Digital Fabrication techniques used</h3>
                    <p>1. <b>Rhino:</b> Designed the construction of the box</p>
                    <p>2. <b>Laser-cutting & Engraving:</b> Engraved the decorative elements and cut out the construction pieces of the box as well as the recipe section dividers.</p>
                    <p>3. <b>CNC Milling:</b> Engraved and cut out our family's signature "logo."</p>
                    <p>4. <b>Incorporating Stock Parts:</b> Drilled in the hinge that opens and closes the box, and added the magnet to secure the box support bar to the bottom of the top lid.</p>

                    <p>I decided to keep the front of the box minimalist. My original plan included a latch but I didn't think it was necessary from a functional point of view. I also thought that aesthetically, it would pull too much focus away from the subtlety of the text and the icon.</b> </p>
                    <img src="final-project/Box-1.jpg" width=1000>
                    <p>The entire bottom panel of the box is an engraving. I liked the contrast between the quiet aesthetic of the front and the drama on the back. The image is an engraving of the art created by Isabelle Arsenault for the book <i>Once upon a Northern Light</i>, written by Jean E. Pendziwol. The book is a loving homage to nature during winter.</p>
                    <p>For the other seasonal recipe boxes I create, I plan to continue the pattern of engraving an artwork that represents that season.</p>
                    <img src="final-project/Box-1.jpg" width=1000>
                    <p>Inside the box, you'll see a few recipes I recently handwrote on 4x6 index cards as well as laser-cut section dividers using discarded matboard and cardboard.</p>
                    <p>On the inside of the top lid is our family name, Bass, that my partner handwrote and I engraved with the CNC Mill. At the bottom of the lid is the support bar that is used to prop the lid open. It is securely fastened using a magnet.</p>

                    <h3>How to use this box</h3>
                    <p>1. Open the lid and sift through the recipes to find the one you want to cook.</p>
                    <img src="final-project/Box-1.jpg" width=1000>
                    <p>2. Pull out the recipe, then take the support bar and hook it vertically to the bottom lip of the top lid and the top lip of the bottom container to prop the lid open. </p>
                    <img src="final-project/Box-1.jpg" width=1000>
                    <p>3. Turn the box around until you see its back. Prop the recipe onto the ledge that juts out from the top surface of the lid.</p>
                    <img src="final-project/Box-1.jpg" width=1000>
                    <p>4. While you cook, let the wintry illustration on the back subtley reminds of the meal's seasonality.</p>

                <h1>Process</h1>

                <h2>Step 1: Designing the box</h2>

                <p><b>Tools:</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>Rhino</li>
                    <li>Laser-cutter (Mill)</li>
                    <li>Quarter-inch plywood (30x20)</li>
                </ol>
                </p>

                <p>My original plan was to parametrically design the box, but after sharing my proposal with Junchao during office hours, he advised me that Grasshopper might be overkill for what I was trying to accomplish. He suggested that it might be easier to construct the shapes in Rhino. So I decided to do just that.</p>
                <img src="final-project/Box-1.jpg" width=1000>
                <p>Other than referencing the photos of the final construction of the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1276860753/personalized-recipe-box-with-wooden?gpla=1&gao=1&&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=shopping_us_-home_and_living&utm_custom1=_k_Cj0KCQiA37KbBhDgARIsAIzce15F8ERZSQdePGMLEGHnBSYURIspVZsqzKMXGU2ewowDy9NEF6xsSd4aAlHHEALw_wcB_k_&utm_content=go_17434234701_144283651144_602523314340_pla-303628061699_c__1276860753_189534521&utm_custom2=17434234701&gclid=Cj0KCQiA37KbBhDgARIsAIzce15F8ERZSQdePGMLEGHnBSYURIspVZsqzKMXGU2ewowDy9NEF6xsSd4aAlHHEALw_wcB">Etsy box</a>that had initially inspired my project – in terms of size dimensions and number of box joints for each panel – I designed the pieces in Rhino from scratch. </p>
                <p>The design process was fairly simple and straightforward. I first measured the thickness of the quarter inch plywood that I bought from the Mill. I'm glad I did this because the thickness was actually .2 inches instead of .25.</p>
                <p>I used that measurement to size the box joints and gaps in my construction pieces.</p>
                <p>I started a new file and, for the sake of simplicity, I set the unit to inches to match the unit settings of the laser cutter.</p>
                <img src="final-project/Box-1.jpg" width=1000>
                <p>The design was constructed using basic Rhino commands: A combination of the rectangle tool, trim, and join commands.</p>
                <p>I laid out all the pieces that I would need and organized them, including all the measurements, using layers and labels.</p>

                <h3>Testing fit</h3>
                <p>Since the foundational essence of my project was a completed box, the most important step to get right was the fit of the box joints, so that's what I started with first. I expected to take several tries before I landed on the perfect fit between all the pieces (not too tight and not too loose).</p>
                <p>I define "Perfect fit" as pieces that interlock and don't fall apart with a light shaking.</p>
                <p>I ran a series of tests to figure out the width of the kerf (the amount of material removed by the laser in a cut) and subsquently the measurement of the cut lines for the box joints.</p>
                <img src="final-project/Box-1.jpg" width=1000>
                <p>The only variable I adjusted in this test was the width of the box joint fingers. I left the width of the gaps the same throughout the experiment at .5 inches, which was the thickness of my plywood material.</p>
                <p>To conserve as much material as possible, I trimmed a tiny section of the box and duplicated those pieces to quickly make my test cuts at various widths.</p>
                <p>The perfect fit turned out to be somewhere in between .51 and .52 inches for the width of the fingers. This meant that the kerf was around 0.014-0.015 mm.</p>             
                <p>So I offset the cut lines by the with of the kerf (0.014"), which set the width of all the fingers at .514". I made that update to all the fingers of my pieces.</p>

                <br>
                <p><b>But wait, there's more!</b></p>
                <p>I also extended the length of the fingers by .010" beyond the thickness of the material (0.2")? Why? Because I didn't like the aesthetic of the burnt edges in the final joints.</p>
                <p>By making the fingers just a bit longer, I knew that I could sand down the burnt edges flush so that the color of the wood stays relatively uniform in the final box.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>Visualizing fit</h3>
                <p>I created a 3d model of the box fit together using the 2d pieces that I had measured and designed as another layer of testing to ensure my pieces actually fit together the way I wanted them to.</p>
                <p>I'm glad that I didn't skip this step and go straight to cutting. Constructing the 3d model of the box in Rhino highlighted additional misalignment and sizing issues with my measurements, which I then corrected in my 2d geometries.</p>
                <p>The 3d model also helped me visualize the final product and helped me decide the placement of various elements, including the recipe ledge on the cover and the location of the seasonal icon.</p>
                <p>It was also much easier for me to design the measurements of the support bar using the 3d model. I did this by opening the lid of the model at roughly the angle that would make for comfortable recipe reading.</p>
                <p>I then used the arc tool (start, end, point on arc) to create the outside arc that intersected a quarter of an inch into the front panel of the bottom box and the front panel of the top lid.</p>
                <p>I used the arc tool to create the inside arc of the support bar and then joined the pieces together using the line tool. I then extruded the shape and used boolean difference to cut out the areas that overlapped with the box.</p>
                
                <br>

                <h2>Step 2: Laser-cutting</h2>

                <p><b>Tools:</b>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Laser-cutter</li>
                        <li>Quarter-inch plywood (30x20 or the largest size that fits the laser-cutter)</li>
                    </ol>
                   </p>

                <br>

                <h3>Adding the engraved elements to my design</h3>
                <p>I exported my design from Rhino as a .dxf file and imported it into Illustrator, making sure that the scale in the import dialog was set to 1:1. I sized my Illustrator artboard to the size of my plywood material.</p>
                <p>After the pieces were laid out on the artboard, minimizing the space in between the pieces to conserve as much material, I started to think about the design of the seasonal icon and illustration.</p>
                <p>I found the jpg of the illustration online, copied and pasted it into Illustrator, and sized it to the dimension of the back panel of the box. The illustration was overlaid on top of the outline of the piece, which was set to 0.001pt stroke to signal cutting and not engraving.</p>
                <p>I traced an icon of a snowflake that I had found online in Figma (since it is ironically much more intuitive of a tool to draw vector illustrations than Adobe illustrator is), exported it as an svg file and then imported it into the file with my soon-to-be-laser-cut pieces in Illustrator.</p>
                <p>I positioned the icon in the center of the top surface of the lid on a separate layer titled "Engraving".</p>

                <br>

                <h3>Laser cut settings</h3>
                <p>The settings that I used to cut my pieces on .2inch thick plywood are: 3 speed, 100 power, and 10 frequency. These settings are written on the cheatsheat at the Mill for cutting through 1/4" plywood.</p>
                <p>I set the Job type as combined since I was both cutting and engraving. I set the Raster speed to 30 and the power to 80 to get a deep engraving of the illustration and the seasonal icon.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
                <p>My first laser-cut run-through was only 80% successful since the laser didn't cut through some parts of my pieces all the way through. I think it was because my plywood board was slightly bent or some parts were thicker than other parts.</p>
                <p>I simply re-laid and re-cut those pieces on a different section of the material, and that seemed to do the trick. I know that one of my classmates changed the vector speed to 2 instead of 3 with a lot of success. I'm definitely going to try that next time.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>The parts fit!</p>
