                    <h2>Idea</h2>
                    <p>For my final project, I'm going to create a seasonal recipe box for index-card sized recipes to keep on my kitchen counter. Ultimately, I would like to create four boxes, one for each season. For the purpose of this assignment, my plan is to create at least one.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>*Note*: Recipe box images on this page are quick photoshop mock-ups based on a <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1276860753/personalized-recipe-box-with-wooden?gpla=1&gao=1&&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=shopping_us_-home_and_living&utm_custom1=_k_Cj0KCQiA37KbBhDgARIsAIzce15F8ERZSQdePGMLEGHnBSYURIspVZsqzKMXGU2ewowDy9NEF6xsSd4aAlHHEALw_wcB_k_&utm_content=go_17434234701_144283651144_602523314340_pla-303628061699_c__1276860753_189534521&utm_custom2=17434234701&gclid=Cj0KCQiA37KbBhDgARIsAIzce15F8ERZSQdePGMLEGHnBSYURIspVZsqzKMXGU2ewowDy9NEF6xsSd4aAlHHEALw_wcB">design I found on Etsy.</a></p>
                    <p>The purpose of these mock-ups is to communicate the central idea and goal of my project. The final product will most likely be aesthetically different from what you see in these images.</p>

                    <h3><b>Problems with digital recipe aggregator solutions</b></h3>
                    <p>1. I have to wake up the phone periodically with my dirty fingers.</p>
                    <p>2. I have to dig through a bunch of annoying ads and text on the website to get to the actual recipe.</p>
                    <p>3. There are plenty of apps that are great at aggregating recipes, but none are great for ‚Äúin-the-moment‚Äù referencing. I've been using Notion app for recipe aggregation up till now. In addition to the problem where the screen goes black every few minutes, I have to tap through a bunch of folders and links to get to the actual recipe.</p>
                    <p>4. My partner is a novice in the kitchen and lazy with cooking. If it takes too much brainpower and more than a few steps to find a recipe, he's going to revert to ordering takeout.</p>
                    
                    <br>

                    <h3><b>Use Case</b></h3>
                    <p>The seasonal recipe box will be used in my kitchen for storing and accumulating recipes for favorite dishes. More than the digital equivalent, the recipe card box will enable simple, distraction-free, hands-free, sharing, contribution and reference during cooking.</p>

                    <h2>Box Design & Dimensions</h2>
                    <p>Made for 4x6 recipe cards.</p>
                    <p>Luckily, it was easy for me to find ai and svg files online for laser-cut recipe box templates. Many creators charge only a small fee to purchase their files.</p>
                    <img src="final-project/existing-template.png" width=1000>
                    <p>Instead of creating the design from scratch, my plan is to start with one of the preexisting templates as a base and make necessary modifications (e.g. adding the recipe card rest, adding the illustrations for engraving...etc.).</p>

                    <h2>Timeline</h2>
                    <p>My goal is to finish my project by Wednesday, Nov 30, which gives a buffer of five full days. Since my project is contingent on using the laser cutter at the Mill or 8, I will focus on finalizing the design of the recipe box and components during their days of closure. That way, I'll have all my files ready for printing and engraving when they reopen on Monday, Nov 28.</p>
                    <p>My project timeline also takes into account days when I know I won't be working, including Thanksgiving and Sabbath Sundays.</p>
